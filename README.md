### Open source my menu!

Rails app that makes a menu of dishes sorted by course types. Users may create, edit, and destroy dishes. Creating a new dish of a certain course does not allow the user to set it as a different course on the new page. Users may change course type or destroy dishes on the dish edit page. Classes were generated with scaffold. SCSS, HTML, and ERB styling was created by myself without templates. Live on http://foodland-julie.herokuapp.com/
